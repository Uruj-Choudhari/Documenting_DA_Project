## Project Overview
The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure the organization maintains a healthy workforce. However, there is a lack of clear performance indicators to track and analyze key HR metrics.. Therefore, there is a need to design and implement a set of KPIs to address the following points:
Employee Count,Attrition Count,Attrition Rate,Active Employees, Average Age,Attrition by Gender,Department-wise Attrition,Number of Employees by Age Group,Job Satisfaction Ratings,Education Field-wise Attrition and Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups.

## Data Source
Employee Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR_Data.csv" file, containing detailed information about employees of the company.

## Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning and Dashboard
- SQL Server -  Data Analysis and Data Validation
- PowerBI- Creating reports and dashbords
- Tableau - Creating reports and dashbords

## Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with
sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;

## Results
The analysis indicates several areas for HR to address:
1. Focus on Retention Strategies: Particularly for departments with high attrition (e.g. R&D dept) and demographics with high turnover rates.
2. Job Satisfaction: While the average satisfaction rating is positive, exploring detailed feedback could uncover specific areas for improvement.
3. Gender and Age-Specific Strategies: Tailoring retention efforts to address the different attrition rates across gender and age groups could improve overall workforce stability.
By using these insights, the HR department can develop targeted strategies to enhance employee retention and satisfaction, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more engaged workforce.
